# Project Title

Convoke

# Description

This is my personal project, one of my assignments during my time at Dev Mountain in Dallas. I build a meet-up web application with the purpose of bring people together for a common purpose, whatever that may be! This site allows an individual to sign in, create a profile, create events, join upcoming events, and chat with other users.
