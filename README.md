# Project Title

Convoke

# Description

This is my personal project, an assignment during my time at Dev Mountain in Dallas, TX. I build a meet-up web application with the purpose of bringing people together for a common purpose, whatever that may be! This site allows an individual to sign in, create a profile, create events, join upcoming events, chat with other users, and many other features!
